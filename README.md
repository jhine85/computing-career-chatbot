# computing-career-chatbot

This course has introduced you to a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) concepts, including chatbots. Chatbots are also known as conversational agents, talkbots, chatterbots, bots, instant message (IM) bots, interactive agents, or artificial conversational entities. Chatbots converse with humans using auditory or textual methods. These chatbots are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner. Chatbots alleviate the call volume of call centers by providing support to customers, provide assistance to shoppers by recommending products, help locate the best place to buy your favorite dish or order food, talk with you about a specific topic, or help you acquire information.



In this task, you will use the Pandorabot environment to create a conversational agent for the given scenario. Your chatbot will interact with students who are about to graduate. You will document the development of the chatbot and investigate the best calibration approaches and AI optimization methods that support the chatbot in having the required functionalities in the most efficient way.

A.  Explain the functionalities of the chatbot and how they will meet the needs described in the scenario.



B.  Identify five computing job types that your chatbot can recommend based on student interaction with the chatbot.



C.  Provide the generated chatbot code files to support the five identified job types from part B.



D.  Explain how the chatbot training cases were selected and how you used artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) to enhance the functionality of the chatbot. Provide examples of the chatbot’s functionality that represent the selected cases at the end of the training process in support of your explanation.



E.  Create an installation manual for the chatbot that includes the web link to access the live chatbot in the Pandorabot platform.



F.  Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot development environment and explain how they supported or impeded the construction of the chatbot.



G.  Explain how the chatbot will be monitored and maintained to improve the final user experience.



H.  Provide a Panopto video recording that includes a verbal summary of the capabilities of your chatbot and an example of human interaction with the chatbot in which it provides meaningful career advice.
